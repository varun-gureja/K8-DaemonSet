A DaemonSet makes sure it creates one pod on each existing node.
Certain cases exist when you want a pod to run on each and every node in the cluster and each node needs to run exactly one instance of the pod.
Those cases include infrastructure-related pods that perform system-level operations.
 For example:
log collector and a resource monitor on every node. 
kube-proxy process, which needs to run on all nodes to make services work.
